                <h1>Palm Trees</h1>
                <p>We grow 800 different species of palms that will grow in Southern California.  This includes smaller and larger plants that you've never seen anywhere!  There are plants for sun and shade.  And, plants that stay small or get large.  We specialize in plants that you'll not find in the "Big Box Stoes" so that your garden can be unique and different.  These include dwarf sun loving species and desert palms.  We also have a great selection of shade loving palms, both dwarf species and tall, bamboo type palms.  We offer over 800 species of palms in a whole assortment of sizes.  You can search far and wide and nowhere will you see the same variety we offer on a daily basis. </p>

                <h1>Cycads</h1>
                <p>We grow cycads from seeds but also, over the years, have imported many exciting species as actual plants or caudexes.  Cycads are the most coveted, protected and historically significant plants that exist on this planet.  They have evolved little since the time of the dinasaurs.  We actively purchase domestic collections.  All this results in our offering to you species that you've probably never seen before.  You no longer have to be content with the common Sago Palm.  We have plants of all sizes and appearances, something right for everyone's budget.  Included in our inventory are the very sought after blue African Cycads.  Interesting seedlings are always available.  We feel we have the most extensive offering of unusual and rare cycads of any nursery. </p>

                <h1>Tropical Plants</h1>
                <p>Our nursery attempts to offer customers the finest of colorful tropical plants, especially colorful items.  This includes typically an assortment of Ti, Heliconia, Bromeliads, Croton, Ferns, Philodendron and many other tropical companion plants. </p>
                <p>Many people visit for these plants alone. It is important to realize that many tropical species won't grow in all localities of Southern California.  We can offer advice as to the types best suited for your individual climate and sun exposure. </p>
